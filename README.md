# Island Router

This is an experiment to learn how SPA routing works, and how I could potentially persist state of web components on navigation.

The router implementation is based on [this article](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/5).

I need to take a look at how Astro does it:

- https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/src/transitions/router.ts

I can get this working on Astro if I'm using a framework component. It behaves roughly the same when I use raw web components.
